# Workshop YAAW

Yet Another AI Workshop (YAAW) is a workshop led by Chia-Ching Yen under the umbrella of Workspace Raccoon. While Workspace Raccoon delves deeply into robotic construction within architecture, the workshop ventures beyond the tangible, intertwining computational methodologies to redefine the architectural narrative.

At the heart of the studio lies a profound curiosity: how can algorithms, data, and digital tools amplify the designer’s imagination? By embracing computational processes, we navigate uncharted territories—exploring realms that transcend physical boundaries, diving into the intricate dynamics of virtual social networks, and utilizing GIS tools to transpose and remap dimensions.

This exploration extends to data mining with the aid of advanced models, such as large language models (LLMs), where patterns hidden within complexity reveal themselves as opportunities for innovation. Through these investigations, we assemble a repertoire of techniques that not only reframe how we perceive the world but also how we shape it.

Ultimately, these tools forge new pathways back to construction—be it robotic, computer-aided, or even manual—crafting novel approaches that challenge and expand the scope of modern architectural practice.
